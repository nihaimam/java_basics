PROBLEM 1: TESTING
==================

(10%) The correct implementation is #: (fill in your answer below

imp #: imp 9

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN FAULTY IMPLEMENTATIONS
----------------------------

(4%) Describe the general problems with imp4

    the mode method in imp4 is faulty, it usually returns only one mode.

(4%) Describe the general problems with imp5
    
    the mode method in imp5 is faulty, throwing null pointer exception.                                

(4%) Describe the general problems with imp6

    the unique method in imp6 is faulty, it returns the list going backwards.

PROBLEM 2: DEBUGGING
====================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(55%) Include the command line you found to pass as many phases as
possible. Include your NetID at the beginning.  To complete all
phases, a total of 29 command line args including NetID are required.

    nimam 30 62 61 10 16 46 1 1 6 13
    abcdefgabcdefg 0 7 13 1 3 -3 48 4
    "with great power comes a big electricity bill" 
    0 1 1 1 15 1 2 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5%) Describe your experience using the debugger. What helped, what
frustrated, and what lessons will you take forward? Limit your
description to one to two paragraphs.

    In the beginning I wasnâ€™t comfortable with using the debugger so I was
    tracing the code by hand and thats how I got past phase 2 but after that
    phase 2 things got relatively harder and it got hard to keep track of every
    part of the code on paper. It got to the point where I was sitting among a pile
    papers with code on them. Then I begrudgingly started using the debugger and it
    was a little easier but I still had to keep track of all the variables. Towards
    the end of phase 9 I was tired of the debugger. Its easy to use but with the 
    amount of clustered code in the DebugMe file, it was harder to use it.
